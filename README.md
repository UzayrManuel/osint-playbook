# 🕵️‍♂️ OSINT Playbook

Welcome to my **OSINT Playbook** — my personal collection of notes, strategies, tools, and guides for conducting **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** investigations.

This repo was made to document my learning journey and also maybe to help you:
- Understand core OSINT concepts and processes
- Document methodologies and case studies
- Track and categorize useful tools
- Maintain a structured knowledge base as you grow in the field
