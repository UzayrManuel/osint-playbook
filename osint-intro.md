# OSINT Introduction
## üß† What is OSINT?

**Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to produce actionable intelligence.

> OSINT can mean different things depending on the context:
- For the **CIA**, it may be information gathered from foreign news broadcasts.
- For an **attorney**, it could be official government records accessible by the public.
- For **most people**, it usually refers to data freely available on the internet.

However, **simply finding** this information is **not the final step**. The process must involve structured **collection**, **preservation**, and **reporting** of findings.

## üìù Why Preservation Matters

Online information is not permanent. Websites can shut down, and data may be deleted or altered. You must:
- **Document all findings.**
- **Capture evidence** (e.g., take screenshots, use archive services).
- **Preserve anything important immediately** upon discovery.
