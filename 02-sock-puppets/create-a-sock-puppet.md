# Creating an Effective Sock Puppet for OSINT Investigations

## Introduction and Philosophy

In recent light of the epic failure by Surefire Intelligence to frame Robert Mueller for sexual assault allegations, it’s important to discuss how to make a good sock puppet for OSINT operations. If you aren’t familiar, just Google Jacob Wohl or Surefire Intelligence to see the scandal unfold. For further details on the unraveling of Wohl’s socks, check out Aric Toler’s thread on Twitter [@arictoler](https://twitter.com/arictoler) from Bellingcat.

### What is a Sock Puppet?

The internet commonly defines a sock puppet as “an online identity used for purposes of deception.” This refers to the traditional sock puppet with an unknown 'master of puppets.' However, sock puppets aren’t exclusive to deception; they can also be used for privacy and OPSEC (operational security) by investigators, journalists, penetration testers, etc. OPSEC online protects both the investigator and the target, in case the evidence leads nowhere.

## Defining Your Intent

To make a sock puppet that won’t embarrass you like Jacob Wohl and Surefire Intelligence, start by defining your intent.

- **Option 1:** Create a fake persona with a full identity (e.g., “Eugene Shoemaker”). This takes a long time, is difficult, and carries a higher chance of failure. If discovered, you must delete everything and start over. This is the most effective method if done correctly.
  
- **Option 2:** Create an avatar focused around an idea rather than a unique identity (e.g., Twitter accounts like [@ShakiraSecurity](https://twitter.com/ShakiraSecurity) or [@DutchOSINTGuy](https://twitter.com/DutchOSINTGuy)). Everyone knows these aren’t real people, but they build trust and function in the OSINT and infosec community more easily.

For both options, it’s recommended to:

- Create content and add media (photos, videos)
- Interact authentically online
- Create multiple social profiles
- Gain vouches or connections
- Use unique phone numbers, IP addresses, and email addresses

## The Setup

You can go extreme on anonymity (see Michael Bazzell’s book *Hiding from the Internet*) or take a practical 80/20 approach. Here’s what you need to get started:

- A dedicated computer only for investigations (cheap laptops or Raspberry Pi work)
- Encrypted email (Proton Mail recommended)
- A burner or WiFi phone number (Google Voice is an option)
- Social media profiles where your target is active (choose option 1 or 2 above)
- A couple of virtual machines (e.g., Buscador for OSINT tools, Windows VMs for FOCA)
- A blog or website (free WordPress, Blogger, Medium)
- A reliable VPN with frequent IP changes

## Additional Tips

- Use Chrome extensions like **AdBlock** and **Disconnect Me** to block tracking.
- Verify yourself on platforms like Keybase and participate in Slack or Rocket Chat groups for credibility.
- Let your sock puppet grow organically—don’t rush deployment.
- Consider forensic linguistics to keep your sock’s content unique.
- Regularly collect OSINT on your own sock puppets to find weaknesses.

# The Art Of The Sock  
*By Guise Bule*

Sock puppets are where OSINT meets HUMINT in the infosec jungle. Social media is full of sock puppets influencing millions of conversations. Some are state-sponsored, others corporate, and some are downright malicious. OSINT investigators wear their "socks" to engage targets covertly.

### OSINT and HUMINT Together

You can’t just gather intelligence passively; OSINT requires human interaction (HUMINT) to get deeper insights. To be an effective investigator, you need to master the art of the sock and engage targets on social media *while wearing socks*.

### What is a Sock Puppet?

From the Oxford English Dictionary: *“a person whose actions are controlled by another; a minion.”*  
From an OSINT perspective: *“a social persona worn when engaging the targets of your investigation.”*

A fully fleshed-out sock puppet has a credible social history across platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. This includes:

- Consistent activity over a long time  
- Authentic, organic interactions  
- Separate entities that don’t connect with your other accounts

---

### Think Long Term

Socks must grow over time before deployment. Fresh accounts scream “sock” and won’t be trusted. Use multiple socks since they are disposable—use once, then discard.

---

### Personality Matters

Deception doesn’t work if your target has no reason to believe you’re real. Create a unique personality instead of copying someone else. Engage in role-playing, immerse yourself in the character, and build trust authentically.

Tips from veteran sock masters include:

- Follow and interact with accounts near your target  
- Repost timely, relevant posts to get noticed  
- Let the target initiate contact, don’t be too direct

---

### Beware the Sock Hunters

Sock puppets can be detected by patterns like login times, IP addresses, writing style, and posting activity. Machine learning tools now detect sock puppets with high accuracy by analyzing behavioral fingerprints.

To avoid detection:

- Behave like a normal person  
- Engage authentically  
- Maintain separate identities  
- Stay under the radar until needed
