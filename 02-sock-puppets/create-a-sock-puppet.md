# üß¶ Creating an Effective Sock Puppet for OSINT Investigations

## üé≠ Introduction and Philosophy

In light of the epic failure by Surefire Intelligence to frame Robert Mueller, it‚Äôs important to talk about sock puppets in OSINT. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar, Google ‚ÄúJacob Wohl Surefire Intelligence.‚Äù For a breakdown, check Aric Toler‚Äôs thread on Twitter [@arictoler](https://twitter.com/arictoler) from Bellingcat.

### ü§ñ What is a Sock Puppet?

A sock puppet is ‚Äúan online identity used for purposes of deception‚Äù‚Äîbut in OSINT, they‚Äôre often used for privacy, anonymity, and security. Journalists, penetration testers, and investigators use them to operate without revealing their real identities. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## üéØ Defining Your Intent

Before you start, define what you need:

- **Option 1:** Fake *real person* identity (e.g., ‚ÄúEugene Shoemaker‚Äù)  
  ‚úÖ More believable, ‚ùå riskier and harder to maintain  

- **Option 2:** Avatar around an idea (e.g., [@DutchOSINTGuy](https://twitter.com/DutchOSINTGuy))  
  ‚úÖ Easier, ‚ùå less ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù but often sufficient

For both, you'll want to:

- Add media and content üé®  
- Build a network ü§ù  
- Use clean phone numbers, emails, and IPs üì°  
- Avoid anything traceable to you üßº

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Setup

Start with an 80/20 approach to privacy unless you‚Äôre going full black-ops:

- üîê A dedicated device (cheap laptop or Raspberry Pi)  
- üìß Secure email (ProtonMail recommended)  
- ‚òéÔ∏è Burner number (Google Voice, VoIP)  
- üßë‚Äçüíª Relevant social media platforms  
- üß∞ VMs: Buscador, Windows w/ FOCA  
- üì∞ Blog or simple site (WordPress, Blogger, Medium)  
- üõ°Ô∏è VPN that frequently changes IP

---

## üí° Additional Tips

- Use browser add-ons: **AdBlock**, **Disconnect Me**  
- Join Slack/RocketChat groups for credibility  
- Let your sock grow *organically* üå±  
- Check your own sock‚Äôs OSINT fingerprint  
- Explore forensic linguistics üß¨ for extra stealth

# üßµ The Art Of The Sock  
*By Guise Bule*

Sock puppets are how OSINT meets HUMINT. Social media is crawling with them‚Äîsome from state actors, others for shady influence ops. OSINT professionals also wear socks, but for the right reasons: discreet engagement.

## üïµÔ∏è OSINT Needs HUMINT

Passive intelligence only goes so far. Want deeper insights? You‚Äôll need to interact‚Äîsubtly.

---

### üß¶ What is a Sock?

- A **persona** with a social footprint  
- Not tied to your real identity  
- Has a personality, history, and believable connections  

---

### üï∞Ô∏è Think Long-Term

Don‚Äôt create-and-deploy the same day. Grow the sock over weeks or months. Fake accounts are easy to spot.

---

### üé≠ Personality Matters

Don‚Äôt copy someone‚Äîcreate a unique, believable personality. Be relatable. Follow targets, repost trending content, and interact naturally. Bonus tip: let the *target* message *you*. üòâ

---

### üëÄ Beware of Sock Hunters

Detection is real. Tools can analyze your:

- Login patterns  
- Writing style  
- Device/browser fingerprint  
- Social graphs

To avoid exposure:

- Stay low-profile  
- Be natural  
- Don‚Äôt use your real habits or info  
- Maintain separation üîê
